                <p>Hello! I'm Bethany, the proud founder of Goshen Golden Aussies, an honored Shadowlands affiliate, located near South
                    Hill, VA.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I fell in love with the
                    idea of Golden Aussies over 3 years ago. We carefully selected our Sona (Australian Shepherd)
                    knowing we
                    were hoping to one day breed her and that she would be our foundation dog who would launch us into
                    breeding
                    2nd, 3rd, and even 4th generation Golden Aussies. We've endeavoured to start our program with
                    good quality dogs who are both registered with the American
                    Kennel Club (AKC) since it's known as one of the most prestigious registries in North America. All
                    parents have been health tested through Embark to help ensure our lines represent the best of the
                    breed. We LOVE breeding wonderful family dogs for wonderful families!

        <div class="cardContents column">
            <div class="cardText">
                <p>Since our goal is to produce wonderful family dogs, we’ll be raising our litters with many of the
                    Puppy
                    Culture™ and Empowered Breeder’s protocols to give our puppies a solid foundation. Exposing very
                    young
                    puppies to brief and mildly stressful desensitization protocols stimulates their hormonal, adrenal,
                    and
                    pituitary systems, priming a more balanced response to future stressors. This includes ENS (Early
                    Neurological stimulation), early litter training to help with potty training, introduction to crate
                    training, and exposure to many sounds and new experiences like going for car rides and being well
                    socialized. I've done Puppy Culture with my last two litters and I believe it's really set my pups
                    apart
                    from many. I've recently learned about the Empowered Breeder's Program which has been designed to
                    help
                    produce service and therapy dogs. I believe it will further help our pups go into any situation.
                    Both
                    programs are quite similar, but the Empowered Breeder's Program aligns with my philosophy a little
                    better.</p>

                <p>Our puppies are raised in our home amongst the hustle and bustle of a busy family’s life. We
                    also
                    plan on providing them with carefully planned socialization exercises and experiences throughout
                    their
                    first
                    eight weeks, the intended goal to produce healthy, well-balanced puppies for our buyers. Our puppies
                    are
                    indoor litter trained, which most fully master before going to their new homes, making
                    outdoor potty training much easier for their owners. We also introduce our puppies to the crate and
                    car
                    rides in order to provide as smooth a transition to their new homes as possible. We regularly
                    provide
                    updates on the puppies' progress throughout their
                    first eight weeks, giving our buyers insight into the puppies' personalities, as well as a glimpse
                    into
                    how much time and energy we
                    invest in each litter. None of the above is to imply they are perfectly trained/acclimated before
                    going
                    home, but our puppies and their new owners undoubtedly benefit significantly from our carefully
                    planned
                    and dedicated efforts.

                    clean genetic profile to start our lines, and could not have asked for a better matriach. When she
                    retires from our program, she will be promoted to lap-dog and spend her days watching her

                    interest in carrying things around in her mouth proudly. She also has this really sweet tendency to
                    sit cross-legged on the floor as if she's some kind of model. Any crosses between Koey and another
                    Golden Aussie will yield second-generation Golden Aussies. She was "Winter" in our "Famous TV

                <p>Sometimes you can just tell a dog is special. Haven played tug-o-war with our hearts when she was a
                    puppy and inspired us to keep her even though we weren't planning on keeping a puppy from her
                    litter. She is of slightly smaller body size, a clean mixing of Golden Retriver/Australian Shepherd
                    body style and coat type, is incredibly submissive and tender, and will bring the most darling of
                    characteristics into our program. Haven is our youngest girl and is also Sona's daughter.  She'll be 
                    2 in the new year and we're planning on her having her first litter then!  She's a smaller girl at 
                    just 52 lbs and is sweet, energetic, smart, and fun.  Probably what most immagine a Golden Aussie to 
                    be. She has a little more energy than Koey but can easily chill as well. She does like to try to 
                    demand a lot of attention and sees all touch as love.  Our vet loves her because she even thinks blood 
                    draws must be love because they're touching her and sweet talking her. She's willing to do anything 
                    if she thinks it will make you happy.  She's been Embark tested to show lineage and health.</p>

                    goofball. He has so many silly antics which keep us laughing. He's eager to please, probably 
                    between Koey and Haven on the energy level, but he's still young so he'll probably become 
                    even calmer as he ages a little more. He's also low-shedding for this mix!  He has less 
                    undercoat and he's more of an Aussie shed vs. Golden shed.  Now don't get me wrong... 
                    this mix does shed, but we are working towards lessening it rather than keeping the high, 
                    constant shed of some Golden Retrievers. He has been Embark tested to show lineage and health.</p>

                updates from
                previous litters. We truly love all of our puppies and it is delightful to see their progress as they
                grow and hear from their new families about how their expierence has been, both with finding a new
                companion through us, and with raising our puppies. Check out these reviews from those who received
                puppies from us in the past!
            </p>
            <p class="review">"Working with Bethany to get our puppy, Kylo, was an excellent experience. One of my
                primary concerns was matching with a puppy that would adjust well to living with our cat. Bethany helped
                us pick a pup with a laid back demeanor and little chase drive. It was very easy to teach Kylo to leave
                our cat to herself and now they get along well together. Kylo is a sweet pup who is easy to train and
                plays well with other dogs. I also think that Bethany’s early training with the puppies made our lives
                so much easier. Kylo quickly adjusted to living in a busy city and it was easy to start training him
                since he already knew the clicker." -C.B.</p>
            <p class="review">"I have to say I had a great experience dealing with you, and would recommend you to
                others. You communicated regularly, readily available , easy to reach, responded quickly and took time
                to answer questions. Your care and concern for the dogs really came through in all your communications
                and photos, and was a big factor in providing confidence and trust required for a breeder. I appreciated
                Your chronicling of the pregnancy, birth and first weeks. Sharing those moments really showed your care,
                concern and love for the animals, and provided confidence of your intentions as a breeder. I was also
                very thankful for extra communications you sent providing information about puppy behavior, training and
                handling. It really is a testament to your commitment to raising well adjusted dogs." -J.S.</p>
            <p class="review">"This was my first time adopting a puppy and I couldn't have asked for a better
                experience. Bethany was extremely informative and willing to introduce me to the pups through zoom and
                in-person, not to mention answering all of my questions. Benny was well-mannered when I brought him home
                thanks to her Puppy Culture training, waiting patiently for food from the start which I can tell has
                stuck with him. Would highly recommend if you want a beautiful, loyal, healthy, smart-yet-quirky,
                social, athletic companion with a fun personality." -B.D.</p>
            <p class="review">"We were so happy to find Spencer and Bethany who were planning their first litter with
                their female Australian Shepherd. We didn't care which one, last of the pick was fine with us. However,
                they wanted to match personality with future home expectations, so they recommended a specific pup. We
                went with their choice. So glad we did! The preparation of puppy behavior was incredible. Just a couple
                training days and we are a pack! We wouldn't trade Sammy for a million bucks." -W.C.</p>
            <p class="review">"I have to tell you, you have created the best dog ever! We moved,
                yesterday..and..today..our pup was amazing! He watched everything going on, he danced and played and
                stayed out of the movers way. He loves his new home. He now walks almost exclusively off leed, or drags
                his leash behind him. He listens to commands better than any dog I have ever had, and I have had many
                wonderful dogs. He loves everyone and every animal... You bred the perfect dog...at nine months old!
                Amazing, just amazing. Thank you!" - L.M.</p>

        <h1 class="cardTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="cardText">
            <h2 class="question">Where are you located?</h2>
            <p>We live just outside of South Hill, VA in Mecklenburg County, just a short drive to the NC state border.
                It's a little over an hour or so to Richmond Airport and Raleigh-Durham airport.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">How much do your puppies cost?</h2>
            <p>We really wish it were easier to provide a simple answer to this question. It's not as easy as just
                displaying a price-tag, because it tells you nothing about the actual value of the puppy. Our program is
                the result of countless hours of research, dialogue, practice, testing, working through curriculums,
                experimentation, tears, and prayers, and we can't provide a dollar amount without you first
                understanding exactly what you're getting when you get a Goshen Golden Aussie. To learn more about our program and
                our prices, feel free to send us an email telling us a little about yourself and we'd be thrilled to
                talk you through the process!</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">Can you ship a puppy out of state?</h2>
            <p>Simple answer? YES. Complicated answer? Yes-ish. There are options available for both ground and air
                transport of puppies, but the terms vary significantly (especially via airline). If you live outside of
                VA and are interested in a flight nanny to bring you your puppy, send us an email and we will provide
                contact details for groups we've looked into with very reasonable prices. On occasion, my husband has
                agreed to drive puppies to their new owners, assuming the trip there and back can be accomplished within
                a day.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">I live internationally. Can I still get a puppy?</h2>
            <p>Simple answer? Maybe. Complicated answer? Probably not. We cannot assume any liability for incidents
                related to the mountain of red-tape that usually accompanies attempts to ship dogs internationally, and
                we must leave the full responsibility to the buyer to thoroughly research and make sure they understand
                any and all laws pertaining to international animal cargo. That with those peculiar airline requirements
                mentioned above usually renders it too difficult and/or too expensive to transport animals this way. But
                technically...yes. It can happen.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">Can I pick the color and gender of the puppy I get?</h2>
            <p>This is probably the single most common question we get, and I can understand why. So often you have a vision
                for the animal companion you want to bring into your home and the general pattern is to go looking for a way
                to fulfill that vision. That's precisely what we did when we started breeding. We looked for a very particular
                manner, temperament, color, and even size, but mostly because we anticipated breeding and wanted to start
                our program off with the best possible ancestry. So when you come to Goshen to consider getting a puppy, 
                it makes perfect sense to come with expectations and desires. Unfortunately, genetics tend to have their
                own way no matter what I want. I wish there was a way to get everyone the puppy of their dreams, but it has
                been our experience that the careful breeding and upbringing we provide for our puppies will more than
                satisfy all of your desires for a puppy, even if the precise body style or color can't be. We have had litters with
                only two merles and the rest black puppies, and we have had litters with two tris, one black, and the rest
                all merles. That's why we put all of our attention into breeding wonderful temperament, sweet disposition,
                intelligence, and a family-oriented focus into our puppies, because we actually had the most control
                over things like that without crossing an ethical line. If you join a list to receive a puppy, everyone's 
                selection is limited to what that specific litter ended up as, and selection is in the order in which folks
                joined the list. If you'd like to know more about this, I'm happy to discuss through email. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">How big do your puppies get?</h2>
            <p>The smallest our lines have produced is probably Haven, who is currently 45 pounds. The largest we've
                seen is upwards of 60 pounds, so the weights and sizes fluctuate inside that range. When Calgary is
                ready to stud, we will probably see a significant increase in dog weight because we anticipate him being
                a big boy. Haven might help balance out that size increase significantly.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">How much do Golden Aussies shed?</h2>
            <p>Significantly so, but not as much as Golden Retrievers. Sona molts twice a year, so for two weeks, we are
                in hairmageddon with her, but in-between moltings, she barely sheds at all. That's typical for many
                Australian Shepherds. Golden Retirevers, however, are like the snow in Canada. There ain't no way you're
                getting rid of it. This mix results in a blending of those two coat types, and individual puppies might
                lean more towards one type or the other. It's almost impossible to tell which type they will lean
                towards until after they have gone home, but we are getting better over time at noticing it. Either way,
                warm up your vacuum, because it's gonna do some work.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">I live in an apartment. Does this breed do well in apartment settings?</h2>
            <p>Generally speaking, we've seen families that live in apartments have wonderful success with Golden
                Aussies. As a breed, they do well in an apartment as long as they get some attention from the family.
                Just be warned that indications from the dog that they need outside relief should be heeded immediately,
                because it can take a while to get them downstairs and outside, depending on what floor your apartment
                is on. Particular success or difficulty in apartment living would come down to the unique
                characteristics of each puppy. If you live in an apartment and are interested in putting a deposit down
                on a puppy, let us know and we can work with you to find the puppy who would have the most success in
                your living situation.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="question">How can I stay up to date on future litters?</h2>
            <p>Information is pushed regularly through our facebook page, as well as here on this website, but if you
                want insider news, we do have a master email list for people who want updates as early as possible.</p>
